## Introduction

This repository provides code for *On-device Sora*, which is an open-sourced implementation of paper named *On-device Sora: Enabling Diffusion-Based Text-to-Video Generation for Mobile Devices*. 

Instruction to Team 2: 각 부분에 대한 소개를 부탁드립니다.  

### On-Device Sora
*On-device Sora* applies Linear Proportional Leap (LPL), Temporal Dimension Token Merging (TDTM), and Concurrent Inference with Dynamic Loading (CI-DL) to enable efficient video generation on the iPhone 15 Pro.
